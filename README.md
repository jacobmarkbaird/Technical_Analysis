# Technical_Analysis
A neural network using technical analysis values of various companies traded on NASDAQ to predict week closing prices
Edit:
I will be taking a break from this project indefinitely. If I decide to return to the task of developing a technical analysis neural network at a later time it will be after developing a toolkit more tailored to the task at hand than that provided by Oracle, and after greater processing power and a faster internet connection is made available.
